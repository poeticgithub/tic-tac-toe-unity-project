unity engine game tic tac toe

This single player-vs-computer tic tac toe game was created using Unity Game Engine. Works on windows,  iOS, android,  etc. depending on how you build it inside the Unity Game Engine.

I created a rudimentary Artificial Intelligence from a short lookup-table that makes the computer prioritize moves that would lead to a winning game state or would impede the player

Requires an installation of Unity Game Engine version 5.3.4 or newer.

Inside the Unity Game Engine Editor

1. Open this Project.

2. Open Scene : firstLevel

3. Click Play button to test inside the Editor or click on File -> Build Settings to create an executable on your desired platform: Windows, Mac, Linux, Android etc.
